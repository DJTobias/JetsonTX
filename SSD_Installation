###Tested with clean flash of Jetpack 2.2.1 on TX1
###Tested with Intel SSD 730
###Tested on 8/4/2016
###Tested with Tegra210_Linux_R24.1.0_armhf.tbz2
###Tested with Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R24.1.0_armhf.tbz2

###Done on HOST PC go to
https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra
###download latest version .
download Jetson TX1 32-bit Driver Package
download 32-bit Sample Root Filesystem
move both to home directory.

###Extracts files and moves the sample filesystem to rootfs keeps permissions.  Do not use GUI extract

sudo tar -vxjf TegraXXX_Linux_RXX.X.X_armhf.tbz2
cd Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs
sudo tar jxpf ../../Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_RXX.X.X_armhf.tbz2

###Run the apply_binaries.sh script to copy the NVIDIA libraries into rootfs directory.

cd ..
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh

###Format target storage to ext3 and mount it.
###I assume ext4 will also work I may go back and try it with this if I have performance issues.
###use lsblk to make sure you are formatting the correct drive in my case only two storage devices are present on host

sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb

###access SSD storage thru media you may have to individually make each directory below with sudo

mkdir /mnt/jetson
sudo mount /dev/sd? /mnt/jetson

###Copy Sample file system to target storage and unmount it.

cd Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs
sudo cp -a * /mnt/jetson && sync
umount /mnt/jetson

###Turn on JetsonTX1 with previous clean installation of jetpack.
###Tested with clean install of Jetpack 2.2.1

sudo nautilus

###navigate to /boot/extlinux
###locate extlinux.conf
###open with gedit
###locate argument "root=/dev/mmcblk1p1" or something similar to this near the end
###change to "root=/dev/sda"  
###sda assumes that there are no other partitions on the SSD
###save file

###I deleted the ~extlinux.conf generated by gedit for safe measure
###it can be found by using the ls command in /boot/extlinux directory

###Turn off TX1

sudo shutdown -h now

###Make sure that there are no other storage devices except the SSD connected
###Turn on TX1 it should boot as SSD as home and show the internal eMMC as a SDCard on the unity launcher
